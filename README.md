# 🔐 Okta IAM Lab Series

Welcome to my **Okta IAM Lab Series**, where I explore real-world Identity and Access Management concepts using **Okta**. These hands-on labs demonstrate my understanding of user provisioning, group-based access control, role assignment, and policy enforcement — core components of a modern IAM strategy.

> 💡 This lab series is part of my journey into a career in IAM, Security Operations, Vulnerability Management, and Cloud Security.
